# JackRDF
Use JackRDF to...

* easily install a Fuseki triple-store
* convert JSON-LD files to Fuseki served RDF...
	* with support for custom URNs

JackRDF works with [JackSON](https://github.com/caesarfeta/JackSON) to create a hybrid Fuseki/file-system database useful for application development and small-scale hosting.

RDF conversion is mostly done with [ruby-rdf/json-ld](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/json-ld/). 

Read the [W3C draft](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-rdf/) for more info on JSON-LD and RDF's relationship.

## Install the JackRDF gem
	rake build
	gem build JackRDF.gemspec
	gem install JackRDF-1.0.1.gem

## Install Fuseki
	rake server:install

## Config
Open **Rakefile** and change the following config items if necessary.

	FUSEKI_TRIPLES = "/var/www/JackRDF/triples"
	FUSEKI_HOST = "http://localhost"
	FUSEKI_PORT = "4321"
	FUSEKI_DATASTORE = "ds"
	FUSEKI_ENDPOINT = "#{FUSEKI_HOST}:#{FUSEKI_PORT}/#{FUSEKI_DATASTORE}"

## Start
	rake server:start

## Securing
You typically want to allow everyone to query your Fuseki instance; 
however, you probably don't want everyone updating it.

The easiest way I know to secure Fuseki's update features is to use an Apache proxy combined with iptables.

This goes in your Apache config ( usually that is **/etc/apache2/httpd.conf** )

	LoadModule proxy_http_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_proxy_http.so
	ProxyRequests Off
	<Proxy *>
	  Order deny,allow
	  Allow from all
	</Proxy>
	
	<Location /fuseki>
		ProxyPass http://localhost:4321
		ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:4321
	</Location>
	
	<LocationMatch /fuseki/[^/]+/update>
		Order deny,allow
		Deny from all
		Allow from 127.0.0.0
	</LocationMatch>

Then set iptables to drop all packets sent to **:4321** from anywhere but localhost.

	sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s localhost --dport 4321 -j ACCEPT
	sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 4321 -j DROP

To undo this...

	sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -s localhost --dport 4321 -j ACCEPT
	sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 4321 -j DROP

If you're using OSX you don't have **iptables**.  
You can use **pfctl**.
Haven't used it myself but [here's a tutorial.](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/05/15/using-pf-on-os-x-mountain-lion/)

If all goes well... 

* Access to **http://localhost:4321** should be forbidden.
* **http://localhost/fuseki/ds/query** should be accessible to the world.
* **http://localhost/fuseki/ds/update** should be forbidden everywhere but from localhost.
	* This is needed for JackRDF to work.
